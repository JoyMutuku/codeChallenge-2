#My Project Review As a user, I can:

See a list of all animal names. I needed to make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the character data. If click on an animal’s name, I should see its details i.e image and number of votes. The details are displayed one animal at a time. I used the character information from my first request to get the character's details. When viewing an animal’s details, one can add the number of votes for each animal. This number of votes should then be displayed together with the animal’s details. No persistence is needed for the votes.
